# Computer-Vision-based-Intelligent-Medicine-Inspection-and-Sorting-Machine-FYP

It is a Medicine-Strip-sorting automated machine. The Darknet CNN algorithm 
(YOLO) is used to detect defective Medicine-Strip with high accuracy.

# Objective

Main objective of this algorithm is to detect defected medicinal strips and sort them accordingly
defected medicinal strips are beaks, missing medicines and counting 

# Problem
This projects aim to solve the pharmaceutical industry, ensuring the quality and safety of medicinal
products is paramount. Despite advancements in automation for
manufacturing and initial packaging, the final inspection and sorting of
medicines often rely on manual labor. Workers are tasked with identifying
defects such as abnormal medicinal strips. This manual process is not only
time-consuming but also prone to human error, leading to financial losses for
companies due to recalls and reputational damage.
Our proposed solution addresses these challenges by automating the
inspection and sorting process using computer vision and machine learning.
Statistics indicate that manual inspection methods can be insufficient, with
human inspectors potentially missing a significant percentage of defects due to
fatigue, distraction, or the monotonous nature of the task. Some studies
suggest that human error rates in manual inspections can be as high as 20%.
This not only affects product quality but also slows down the production line.
The implementation of such intelligent inspection machines can increase
production efficiency by up to 30% and significantly reduce the likelihood of
defective products reaching the market.
